## Definition
A random variable $X$ follows a log-normal distribution with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ if its pdf is
$$
  f(x)=\frac{1}{x\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{(\ln x-\mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right).
$$

## Sample from a log-normal distribution

We now take a ramdom sample of size 100 from a log-normal distribution with paramaters $\mu=1$, $\sigma=0.25$.

```{r sample}
  x <- rlnorm(100, 1, 0.25)
```

Plotting the histogram of this sample on the original scale and the log scale.

```{r plot}
  par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
  hist(x); hist(log(x))
  par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

## Mean and variance of the sample

The mean and variance of the sample `x` are `r mean(x)` and `r var(x)`, respectively.
